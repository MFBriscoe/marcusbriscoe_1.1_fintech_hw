## Business Activities
#####Solving Problems

At it's foundation, SoFi's initial focus was to address the issue of students' inability to conveniently pay off their student loans after graduation. As graduate students themselves, they addressed this issue by connecting students with alumni who could buy up their debt and allowing them to refinance their loans at a reduced interest rate. Since this was all done between Stanford Alums and students, this also provided a pathway for relationship-building and networking opportunities. In '14 they offered Mortgages. In '15, they opened up personal loans. '16 "SoFi at Work" program. Currently, they offer lower rates on loan refi's. Also, they rendered the platform to be conducted exclusively online with 24/7 customer service for convenience, speed, etc. All service have no fees

#####Who's It For?

According to Steven Dupree, SoFi's former VP of Marketing ('13-'16), the company is targeted to what he calls the "older milennial [who] has invested a lot in education, has a lot of work experience". Based on this demographic, they aim at keeping their platform as mobile friendly as possible, and are readily available as a function of convenience.

The age range of milennials is up for debate, but many use the marker of 1980 as the beginning of the generation, going to about 1994. If we want to narrow down "older milennials" to ages 30-39, that leaves a demographic of 44.2 million potential SoFi customers--roughly 13% of the entire nation.


#####What Separates SoFi From the Rest?

One of the most significant things that SoFi offers is a one-stop-shop for its customers' wealth management. Having grown and diversified their product menu, they can sell a customer multiple products within the finance space at the same time. 

>"Applying for a mortgage? Great! We noticed you also have an outstanding student loan. How would you like to refinance it at a lower rate?"

In any domain in which SoFi lives, (Investing, Loans, Banking, Insurance, etc.), none of its competitors offer the same level of versatility.

*Relationships*

One of SoFi's biggest assets is its approach to its customer base by building a relationship with its customers, treating and referring to them as "members" of a club, rather than marks to take advantage of. Their approach is to make its members feel like they are part of something significant that is growing. They offer exclusive services such as career coaching and financial planning, community-building mixers in local areas, and  even VIP access to the new stadium in Inglewood, CA.

*Blog*

In order to establish a relationship with current and potential customers, SoFi also runs a blog covering topics that milennials are most likely to be concerned about. Topics range anywhere from investing strategies to how to handle your finances after a breakup to networking advice for young professionals.

#####Trending...

Over the last decade, the financial industry has been getting more and more digitized.

Digital Banking has put personal money management in peoples' fingertips through the advent of smartphones. Through easy-to-use interfaces, customers can navigate and move money around at the push of a button.

Along the same lines, peer-to-peer lending allows people to transfer money to each other in a couple of key strokes with zero wait time.

Zelle works in the same way by facilitating major banks to transfer money across accounts.

#####How Does SoFi Measure Up?

## Recommendations


A strong move for SoFi to take would be to set up something similar to a hedge fund that its customers can also invest in on smaller scale similar to their Stock Bits option. For those of its clients who would like to take bigger swings, they can create wealth at a faster rate, and those lower on the income scale can get a taste while also being inspired to get involved in a more aggressive way. This would set SoFi head and shoulders above its competition by being the first Loan-heavy FinTech company the opportunity for its clients to get rich. A combination of Robo-Advising and AI could help push this idea through such that the best moves will be made, and it can be followed and interpretted back to the customers.
